The models for the paper:

Keramati M, Dezfouli A, Piray P (2011) Speed/accuracy trade-off
between the habitual and the goal-directed processes.
PLoS Comput Biol 7:e1002055

were recreated in the paper:

Viejo G, Girard B, Khamassi M (2016) [Re] Speed/accuracy trade-off
between the habitual and the goal-directed processes
ReScience 2(1):1-5

in python (see the README.md in the code folder for installation and
running instructions) available at this github link:

Executing "python run.py" in about 10 minutes on a 2012 macbook pro
reproduced the results of Figure 3 A, B, G, H in a qualitative (all
that Viejo et al. 2016 claimed) manner:
